                            At present, in most coffee plantations, seedlings,
                            rather than being transplanted into the ground, are
                            grown in coffee nurseries. To do this, coffee is
                            planted in fertilized mail, and soon they receive
                            the first sprouts. Then the grain quickly opens and
                            gives the first leaves. Seedlings can be transplanted
                            from the nursery to the field after 6-12 months. As
                            a rule, a young gardener begins to bear the first
                            fruits only after 3 years. After drinking, coffee
                            berries grow green, gradually, as they ripen, acquire
                            darker shades. Ripe berries are usually dark red,
                            some trees have yellow fruits and very rarely, when
                            cross-pollinating coffee trees with red and yellow
                            fruit trees, orange. We can safely say that several
                            factors account for the taste of coffee beans, namely:
                            the climate in the country of growth, harvesting,
                            processing, and, of course, the genetic component
                            of the coffee tree. We touched upon the issue of
                            genetics and origin a little at the beginning of
                            our text, now we dwell in more detail on the methods
                            of harvesting and processing crops.
